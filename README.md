# VEDS File Preparation

As part of my role at Bergen Community College, I prepared and validated the VEDS (Vocational Education Data System) file for submission to state agencies. This process involved:

- Cleaning and structuring student-level data to meet reporting requirements
- Automating portions of the validation process using Python and SPSS syntax
- Collaborating with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and compliance

## Tools
- SPSS (syntax automation, validation)
- Python (data cleaning)
- Excel

## Note
No actual data or file contents are shared in this repository due to confidentiality.
