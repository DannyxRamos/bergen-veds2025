# VEDS File Preparation and Validation

As part of my role as Research Analyst at Bergen Community College, I prepared and validated the VEDS (Vocational Education Data System) file for submission to the New Jersey Department of Education. The VEDS file captures data on students enrolled in Perkins-eligible career and technical education (CTE) programs and must meet detailed reporting requirements as outlined in the official data dictionary.

## ðŸ“Š My contributions
- Interpreted the VEDS data dictionary to create the required file structure and variables
- Cleaned and transformed data from multiple internal sources to match VEDS specifications
- Automated portions of the data validation and file preparation using **Python**
- Verified data integrity and alignment with reporting standards (e.g., correct coding of demographic variables, program codes, credential data)
- Collaborated with institutional stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness of data

## ðŸ›  Tools used
- Python (data cleaning, automation of validation checks)
- Excel (manual reviews, final file formatting)
- SPSS syntax (additional data checks)

## ðŸ“‚ Included files
- `Adult VEDS2020 Data Dictionary.pdf` â€” official data dictionary used to guide file preparation (public document)

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- No actual student data or VEDS submission files are included here due to confidentiality.
- This repository is intended to illustrate my role and approach in preparing large-scale, compliance-driven reports.
